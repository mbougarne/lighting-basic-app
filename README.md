# Lighting Basic App

A basic app using the [Lighting JS Framework](https://lightningjs.io/)

## Experience

The Lighting JS framework is interesting one, I never imagined that I'll work with JavaScript in that way. I enjoyed working it, there's a lot of new stuff to learn. The object oriented way of using JS I didn't work with it before, but I like it. The biggest down side of the framework is the lack of learning resources.

I think, using TypeScript with the framework would be much more easier than vanilla JS since TS has a lot of OO features than JS (namespaces, enums, ...). I didn't know how to make the menu be in horizontal way, I tried to use the `List` from the `Lighting UI` but without success, that's due to the lack of learning resources about the framework as I said.

The best thing about the `lng` for me is how they handle the focus, based on my experience with `HBO` working on `HBO Max` app, the focus was one of the hardest parts of the app to handle, especially while the accessibility is on `VoiceOver` on `TVOS` or `Xbox` devices, but I see that we have somehow a full control over the focus using `lng` since it render everything with `WebGL`, which means will control the focus with the framework even on `TVOS` devices while the `a11y` is on (not sure though), which we can't do on the `HBO Max` side, since the focus is controlled by `Apple`.

I believe the `Lighting JS` is painting the app literally using `WebGL` and `Canvas` APIs.
